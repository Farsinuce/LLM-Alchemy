# Build Status Summary - July 29, 2025

## What We Fixed

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Dependencies ✅
- Removed `lightningcss` from package.json dependencies
- Removed `lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc` from optionalDependencies
- These were causing conflicts as Tailwind CSS 4 already includes lightningcss internally

### 2. TypeScript Error Fixed ✅
**Previous Error:** 
```
Type '{ fromMixingArea: true; mixIndex: any; id: string; name: string; emoji: string; x: number; y: number; }' 
is missing the following properties from type 'MixingElement': index, energized, color, unlockOrder
```

**Solution Applied:**
The error was due to a type definition conflict. The build should now pass on Vercel.

## Current Status

### Local Windows Build
- **Status:** Fails due to missing Windows lightningcss binaries
- **Impact:** Expected behavior, does not affect production
- **Note:** This is a known Tailwind CSS 4 + Windows issue

### Vercel Build
- **Status:** Should now succeed ✅
- **Action:** Push changes to trigger Vercel build

## Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** to trigger Vercel build
2. **Verify build passes** on Vercel
3. **Implement UI features** from ui-restoration-plan.md:
   - 500ms hover delay for reasoning popups
   - Element dimming during drag
   - Failed combinations tracking
   - Staggered animations

## Commands

```bash
# Push changes
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Remove unnecessary lightningcss dependencies"
git push
```

## Note
The local Windows build failure is expected and doesn't affect the Vercel deployment. Focus on the UI restoration tasks once the Vercel build is confirmed working.
