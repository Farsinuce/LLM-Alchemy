# Build Status Summary

## TypeScript Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

### What We Fixed
1. **MixingAreaView Type Error**: Fixed the `draggedElement.current` assignment that was missing required properties (color, unlockOrder, etc.)
   - Solution: Find the full element from mixingArea array instead of using the partial element passed to the handler
   - Applied to both `onMixingElementMouseDown` and `onMixingElementTouchStart` handlers

### Verification
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes without errors ✅
- TypeScript compilation is now clean

## Local Build Issue - Windows-specific

### Current Problem
- `npm run build` fails with: `Cannot find module '../lightningcss.win32-x64-msvc.node'`
- This is a Windows-specific issue with native bindings for lightningcss
- **This will NOT affect Vercel builds** (Vercel runs on Linux)

### Why This Doesn't Block Us
1. TypeScript errors are fixed (verified with `tsc`)
2. The lightningcss issue is environment-specific to Windows
3. Vercel's Linux environment has proper lightningcss binaries

## Next Steps

1. **Push the TypeScript fixes to trigger Vercel build**
   - The TypeScript errors that were failing on Vercel are now fixed
   - Vercel should build successfully

2. **Continue with Phase A2 from the restoration plan**
   - Test basic element combination (Water + Fire = Steam)
   - Verify drag & drop functionality
   - Check other gameplay features

3. **For local Windows development** (optional fixes):
   - Could try: `npm install --force lightningcss`
   - Or use WSL for local builds
   - Or temporarily disable CSS optimization in next.config.ts

## Summary
The critical TypeScript errors preventing Vercel builds have been resolved. The local Windows build issue is separate and won't affect deployment.
