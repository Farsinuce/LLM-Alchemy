Generate science-based element combinations.
Current unlocked elements: ${elements.map(e => e.name).join(', ')}
Mixing: ${mixingElements.map(e => e.name).join(' + ')}

CONTEXT: This is a discovery game where players combine elements. Not every combination works - that's part of the challenge. Returning null for illogical combinations is expected and good game design.

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
Elements represent tangible objects, materials, organisms, or fundamental phenomena - never mundane human actions (stirring, grinding) or abstract concepts (happiness, speed, infinity).

SCIENTIFIC GROUNDING:
1. Generate ONLY outcomes with clear scientific logic
2. Results must be well-known at high school level (no obscure terms)
3. If no logical connection exists between elements, return null
4. Mixing the same element with itself CAN produce results if scientifically valid

SCALE & SCOPE:
- Physical objects: molecule to building sized
- Natural phenomena: can exceed building scale if fundamental (Atmosphere, Magnetic Field, Gravity)
- Use concrete manifestations (Decay not Death, Electricity not Power)

FUNDAMENTAL COMBINATIONS REMINDER:
Basic element combinations ALWAYS produce basic results, regardless of game progress:
- Water + Fire = Steam (never Obsidian or advanced materials)
- Fundamental + Fundamental = Simple outcome
- Complex outcomes require at least one complex input

REDUNDANCY PREVENTION:
- Never create elements too similar to existing ones
- If outcome would be similar, return the existing element name instead
- Highly specific variants can exist as End Elements if sufficiently distinct

TECHNOLOGY RULES:
- Natural/ancient tech: normal elements (Brick, Glass, Wheel)
- Industrial tech: normal elements approaching end territory (Engine, Turbine)
- Modern high-tech: MUST be End Elements (Computer, Telescope, Laser Cutter)
- Technology complexity caps at: Computer, Smartphone, Laser Cutter (all End Elements)

END ELEMENTS (mark isEndElement: true):
- Peak technology: Computer, Telescope, Hologram
- Ultimate materials: Diamond, Obsidian
- Complex organisms: Fish, Arthropod, Carnivorous Plant
- Highly specialized outcomes with no logical progressions

VALID ELEMENT TYPES:
✓ Natural materials (Rock, Sand, Metal)
✓ Living organisms (Plant, Bacteria, Mushroom)
✓ Natural phenomena (Rain, Lightning, Photosynthesis)
✓ Chemical compounds (Water, Salt, Sugar)
✗ Human actions (Mixing, Cutting, Boiling)
✗ Abstract concepts (Love, Speed, Past)
✗ Adjective versions (Hot Water, Energized Rock)

RARITY SYSTEM:
Generate 1-3 possible outcomes based on scientific logic:
- "common": The most expected/obvious outcome
- "uncommon": A less obvious but scientifically valid outcome  
- "rare": An unexpected but possible outcome
Only include outcomes that make scientific sense - don't force rarities.

REASONING REQUIREMENT:
Every result needs a brief (15-60 character) scientific explanation.

TAGS REQUIREMENT:
- Assign 1-3 relevant tags for achievement tracking
- Science tags: "lifeform", "organism", "mineral", "compound", "metal", "plant", "animal", "chemical", "gas", "liquid", "solid"
- Achievement tags: "food", "tool", "disaster", "danger", "electrical", "optical", "explosive", "toxic", "radioactive", "magnetic", "thermal"

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object:
{
  "outcomes": [
    {
      "result": "Element Name",
      "emoji": "appropriate emoji",
      "color": "hex color",
      "rarity": "common",
      "isEndElement": false,
      "reasoning": "brief explanation",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    }
  ]
}
Or if no valid combination:
{
  "outcomes": null,
  "reasoning": "No reaction"
}
