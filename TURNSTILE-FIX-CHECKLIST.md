# Turnstile Captcha Fix - Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Immediate Stability (COMPLETED)

- [x] Version locked Turnstile script with `?render=explicit` in `layout.tsx`
- [x] Updated `turnstile.ts` with better error messages
- [x] Added `getTurnstileTokenWithStatus()` for user-friendly error reporting
- [x] Kept existing timeout logic (5 seconds)

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Re-Enable Security with Good UX (COMPLETED)

- [x] Re-enabled captcha in `AuthModal.tsx` for login, register, and magic links
- [x] Added captcha state tracking (`idle`, `checking`, `failed`, `success`)
- [x] Show "Verifying security..." message during captcha check
- [x] Clear error messages for captcha failures
- [x] Feature flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_ENABLED` (defaults to true)
- [x] Google OAuth excluded from captcha (handles own security)

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Server-Side Verification (COMPLETED)

- [x] Created `/api/verify-turnstile` endpoint
- [x] Fail-open pattern if secret key not configured
- [x] Proper error handling and logging
- [x] IP address tracking for additional security

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Pragmatic Testing (COMPLETED)

- [x] Created `/test-captcha` page for debugging
- [x] Tests invisible/interaction-only mode
- [x] Tests visible captcha fallback
- [x] Tests server-side verification
- [x] Shows debug info (user agent, viewport)

## üìã Manual Test Checklist

### Desktop Testing:
- [ ] Anonymous signup works with captcha
- [ ] Login works with captcha
- [ ] Registration works with captcha
- [ ] Magic link works with captcha
- [ ] Google OAuth works (no captcha)
- [ ] Captcha timeout shows user message
- [ ] Game works when Turnstile is down

### Mobile Testing:
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome
- [ ] Invisible captcha works
- [ ] Visible fallback works if needed
- [ ] No more 10+ second hangs
- [ ] Clear error messages shown

## üîß Environment Variables Needed

Add to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Add environment variables to Vercel
2. Deploy to production
3. Test `/test-captcha` page on mobile
4. Monitor for captcha errors in logs

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur, quickly disable captcha:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=false` in Vercel
2. Redeploy (takes ~1 minute)
3. Captcha will be bypassed but auth still works

## üìä Success Metrics

- Mobile load time < 3 seconds
- No infinite loops or hangs
- Clear error messages for users
- Auth success rate > 95%

## üêõ Known Issues to Monitor

1. Turnstile API changes (we're now version locked)
2. Mobile browsers with strict security settings
3. Users with ad blockers (fail gracefully)
4. Network timeouts in poor connectivity

## üí° Future Improvements (Not Urgent)

- Add captcha retry button in UI
- Implement visible captcha fallback in AuthModal
- Add analytics for captcha success rates
- Consider implementing rate limiting as backup
