# Turnstile Captcha Fix - Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Immediate Stability (COMPLETED)

- [x] Version locked Turnstile script with `?render=explicit` in `layout.tsx`
- [x] Updated `turnstile.ts` with better error messages
- [x] Added `getTurnstileTokenWithStatus()` for user-friendly error reporting
- [x] Kept existing timeout logic (5 seconds)

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Re-Enable Security with Good UX (COMPLETED)

- [x] Re-enabled captcha in `AuthModal.tsx` for login, register, and magic links
- [x] Added captcha state tracking (`idle`, `checking`, `failed`, `success`)
- [x] Show "Verifying security..." message during captcha check
- [x] Clear error messages for captcha failures
- [x] Feature flag: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_ENABLED` (defaults to true)
- [x] Google OAuth excluded from captcha (handles own security)

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Server-Side Verification (COMPLETED)

- [x] Created `/api/verify-turnstile` endpoint
- [x] Fail-open pattern if secret key not configured
- [x] Proper error handling and logging
- [x] IP address tracking for additional security

## ‚úÖ Phase 4: Pragmatic Testing (COMPLETED)

- [x] Created `/test-captcha` page for debugging
- [x] Tests invisible/interaction-only mode
- [x] Tests visible captcha fallback
- [x] Tests server-side verification
- [x] Shows debug info (user agent, viewport)

## ‚úÖ Phase 5: Clean Architecture Implementation (COMPLETED)

- [x] Refactored `turnstile.ts` to implement proper explicit+execute pattern
- [x] Created `initTurnstile()` helper for forms - one pattern for everything
- [x] Removed complex timeout/retry logic and hidden containers
- [x] Updated `AuthModal.tsx` to use explicit+execute pattern correctly
- [x] Fixed the widget positioning - now inline in forms, visible when needed
- [x] Kept `getTurnstileToken()` for automated flows (anonymous user creation)
- [x] Updated test page to demonstrate both patterns clearly

### Key Architecture Changes:
- **No more hidden divs at `-9999px`** - widgets are rendered where users can interact
- **Single-use tokens handled properly** - reset widget after each use
- **Explicit+Execute pattern** - render once, execute on form submit
- **Visible fallback built-in** - if interaction needed, widget appears inline

## üìã Manual Test Checklist

### Desktop Testing:
- [ ] Anonymous signup works with captcha
- [ ] Login works with captcha
- [ ] Registration works with captcha
- [ ] Magic link works with captcha
- [ ] Google OAuth works (no captcha)
- [ ] Captcha timeout shows user message
- [ ] Game works when Turnstile is down

### Mobile Testing:
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome
- [ ] Automated flow shows widget bottom-right if needed
- [ ] Form submission shows widget inline if needed
- [ ] No more 10+ second hangs
- [ ] No more "401 PAT" errors
- [ ] Clear error messages shown

## üîß Environment Variables Needed

Add to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. Add environment variables to Vercel
2. Deploy to production
3. Test `/test-captcha` page on mobile
4. Monitor for captcha errors in logs

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur, quickly disable captcha:
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=false` in Vercel
2. Redeploy (takes ~1 minute)
3. Captcha will be bypassed but auth still works

## üìä Success Metrics

- Mobile load time < 3 seconds
- No infinite loops or hangs
- Clear error messages for users
- Auth success rate > 95%
- No "401 PAT" errors in console
- Tokens successfully refresh between attempts

## üêõ Fixed Issues

1. ‚úÖ Hidden widget at `-9999px` preventing mobile interaction
2. ‚úÖ Single-use token errors on page refresh
3. ‚úÖ Complex timeout/retry logic causing race conditions
4. ‚úÖ Multiple widget instances without cleanup

## üí° Future Improvements (Not Urgent)

- Add retry button directly in the captcha error state
- Add analytics for captcha interaction rates
- Consider implementing rate limiting as backup
- Add E2E tests with Playwright for mobile viewport
