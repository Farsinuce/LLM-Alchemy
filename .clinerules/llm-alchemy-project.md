## Brief overview
Project-specific guidelines for the LLM Alchemy game restoration and development. LLM Alchemy is a small, casual, web-based alchemy game where players combine elements to discover new ones. The outcomes of these combinations are dynamically generated by an LLM, creating a unique and endlessly expandable gameplay experience.

## Development approach
- Follow established restoration plan step-by-step (new-restoration-plan.md)
- Don't build locally with "npm run build", but instead commit and push to git (for vercel to auto-redeploy) when something needs testing
- E2E tests run via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) against live deployment to avoid Windows issues

## Documentation Requirements
-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md
