# LLM Alchemy: Refactoring & Redesign Preparation Plan

**Objective:** To refactor the codebase to be more modular, maintainable, and scalable, creating a solid foundation for the upcoming OpenMoji-style visual redesign.

---

## **Phase 1: Foundational Cleanup (Low Risk, High Reward)** ✅ **COMPLETE**

This phase focuses on cleaning up existing code, reducing duplication, and improving security without making major architectural changes.

**STATUS: 100% COMPLETE - All objectives achieved, production verified ✅**

### **Step 1.1: Consolidate & Secure Supabase Clients** ✅ **COMPLETED**

*   **Goal:** Create secure, separated entry points for Supabase clients that prevent RSC boundary violations and secret leakage.
*   **Security Requirements:**
    - Prevent server-only imports (like `next/headers`) from being bundled in client code
    - Ensure service role keys never leak to the browser
    - Maintain clear separation between browser and server contexts

*   **Current Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    - ✅ `src/lib/supabase/{browser.ts,server.ts,helpers.ts,index.ts}` created with proper separation
    - ✅ Safe barrel export in `index.ts` (browser-only symbols)
    - ✅ **VERIFIED**: All imports updated to correct paths (no legacy imports found)
    - ✅ **COMPLETE**: ESLint security fully implemented (all rules active)

*   **COMPLETED ACTIONS:**

    **Task 1: Run Codemod** ✅ **DONE**
    - All client components now import from `@/lib/supabase` (safe barrel export)
    - All API routes correctly import from `@/lib/supabase/server`
    - Search verification: No legacy `@/lib/supabase` imports remain in codebase

    **Task 2: ESLint Security Rules** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    - ✅ `import/no-restricted-paths` rule active (prevents client/server boundary violations)
    - ✅ `no-restricted-imports` rule active (prevents deprecated file usage)
    - ✅ `import/no-cycle` rule active (prevents circular dependencies)
    - All security boundaries properly enforced

### **Step 1.2: Centralize & Secure Type Definitions** ✅ **COMPLETED**

*   **Current Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
    - ✅ `src/types/` directory with proper organization
    - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Database type automation scripts added to package.json
    - ✅ **RESOLVED**: No duplicate Achievement type conflicts found

*   **COMPLETED ACTIONS:**

    **Task 3: Automate Database Types** ✅ **DONE**
    - Added `gen:types` script to package.json for automated DB type generation
    - Added `typecheck` script for TypeScript validation
    - Scripts ready for CI/CD integration

    **Task 4: Consolidate Achievement Interface** ✅ **NOT NEEDED**
    - Investigation showed no duplicate Achievement type definitions
    - Single centralized version in `src/types/game.types.ts` already working correctly
    - TypeScript compilation passes without conflicts

### **Step 1.3: Safety & Quality Measures** ✅ **COMPLETED**

*   **COMPLETED ACTIONS:**

    **Task 5: Add Regression Prevention** ✅ **DONE**
    - ✅ Calendar reminder set for deprecated shim removal (1 sprint from merge)
    - ✅ CI/CD integration implemented with GitHub Actions workflow
    - ✅ Type generation, lint, and build verification active in CI

## **Phase 2: The Great Component Refactor (Medium Risk, High Reward)**

✅ **COMPLETE - FINISHED July 29, 2025**
📊 **STATUS: 100% COMPLETE - All Sprint 1 & Sprint 2 objectives achieved**

This phase tackles the monolithic `LLMAlchemy.tsx` component, which is the most critical step for enabling the redesign.

### **🎯 GUIDING PRINCIPLE: STABILITY & EFFICIENCY WITHOUT OVER-ENGINEERING**

**Core Values:**
- **STABILITY FIRST:** Keep what works working, test changes before committing
- **EFFICIENCY:** Extract components only when it genuinely improves maintainability  
- **NO OVER-ENGINEERING:** Simple, readable code > clever patterns. This is a fun indie game, not enterprise banking software.
- **PRACTICAL FOCUS:** Create clean boundaries for OpenMoji redesign, don't build a component library

**What This Means:**
- Extract only obvious, self-contained pieces
- Keep prop interfaces simple and straightforward
- No premature abstractions or complex patterns
- Maintain working state, but downtime during refactoring is acceptable (pre-launch)

### **SIMPLIFIED APPROACH (Feature Flag Removed)**

**Key Strategy Changes:**
- ✅ **SIMPLIFIED:** Removed feature flag complexity - using refactored version directly
- Keep ephemeral UI state (hoveredElement, shakeElement) as local component state
- Use GameStateProvider context to avoid prop drilling
- Focus on domain/persistent state in reducer only

**State Architecture:**
```typescript
// Domain/persistent state in reducer
interface GameState {
  // Core game data
  elements: Element[]
  endElements: Element[]
  combinations: Record<string, string | null>
  gameMode: 'science' | 'creative'
  
  // Game logic
  mixingArea: MixingElement[]
  achievements: Achievement[]
  failedCombinations: string[]
  
  // Undo/redo
  lastCombination: LastCombination | null
  undoAvailable: boolean
  totalCombinationsMade: number
}
```

- `GameHeader.tsx` - Top navigation, search, controls, and game mode toggle
- `ElementListView.tsx` - Scrollable element grid with search/filter functionality  
- `MixingAreaView.tsx` - Drag-and-drop mixing area with visual feedback
- All components properly typed with GameElement interface
- Clean prop interfaces with callback patterns
- Modular exports via components/index.ts

**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** All missing UI components implemented and working!

**Completed in this session (July 28, 2025):**
- ✅ **Fixed missing state variables:** Added `showAchievements`, `unlockAnimationStartTime` with proper usage
- ✅ **Implemented Unlock Modal:** Displays when `showUnlock` is set, shows new discoveries with achievement integration
- ✅ **Implemented Achievements Modal:** Displays when `showAchievements` button is clicked, shows all unlocked achievements
- ✅ **Cleaned up dead code:** Removed truly unused `undoUsed` variable
- ✅ **Added ESLint suppressions:** For variables used indirectly (`unlockAnimationStartTime`, `currentChallenges`)
- ✅ **Fixed TypeScript errors:** Corrected Achievement interface property usage (`name` instead of `title`, `emoji` instead of `icon`, `unlocked` instead of `unlockedAt`)
- ✅ **All ESLint/TypeScript errors resolved:** Component now compiles and lints cleanly

**✅ CORE MIXING FUNCTIONALITY WORKING:** Verified that Water + Fire = Steam works in production with new state management.

### **Step 2.1: Isolate State Management with a Reducer**

*   **Goal:** Extract the complex game state logic from the `LLMAlchemy.tsx` component. This can be done with almost no visual changes, making it a safe first step.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  Create a new custom hook, `useGameState.ts`, that uses React's `useReducer` hook.
    2.  The reducer will manage all state transitions: adding elements, handling combinations, resetting progress, etc.
    3.  The `LLMAlchemy.tsx` component will then call `const { state, dispatch } = useGameState();` to manage its data.
    4.  Pure game logic (e.g., checking for valid combinations) will be moved to a new `src/lib/game-logic.ts` file and called from the reducer.

### **Step 2.2: Extract Presentational Components**

*   **Goal:** Break down the UI of `LLMAlchemy.tsx` into smaller, reusable components.
*   **Implementation:** Create the following new components:
    *   `GameHeader.tsx`: The top bar with titles, buttons, and the game mode toggle.
    *   `ElementListView.tsx`: The scrollable list of discovered elements.
    *   `MixingAreaView.tsx`: The drag-and-drop area.
    *   `Modals/UnlockModal.tsx` and `Modals/AchievementsModal.tsx`: The modals, extracted into their own files.
    *   Each of these components will receive state and dispatch functions as props from the main game component.

### **Step 2.3: Isolate Side Effects into Hooks**

*   **Goal:** Move non-UI logic like audio and animations into their own dedicated hooks.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  Create `useGameAudio.ts`: This hook will contain all the Web Audio API logic for playing sounds. Components will simply call `play('pop')`.
    2.  Create `useGameAnimations.ts`: This hook will manage the state and logic for triggering CSS animations.

### **Preparation Tasks (Can Start in Parallel)**
*   Scaffold empty `useGameState.ts`, `game-logic.ts` with TODO comments
*   Create empty presentational component shells
*   Set up Storybook with Tailwind preset for isolated UI development

---

## **Phase 3: Modernize Styling Workflow (Low Risk, Medium Reward)**

*   **Goal:** Adopt a hybrid styling approach that is both powerful and maintainable, perfect for the redesign.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Keep Tailwind for Utilities:** Continue to use Tailwind CSS for the majority of styling (layout, colors, spacing, etc.).
    2.  **Use CSS Modules for Encapsulation:** For components that require complex, scoped styles (like custom keyframe animations or overrides for the OpenMoji SVGs), create a `[ComponentName].module.css` file.
    3.  This approach provides the best of both worlds: the speed of utility-first CSS and the safety of scoped component styles.

---

## **Phase 4: Improve Developer Experience & Quality (Ongoing)**

These are smaller tasks that can be incorporated throughout the process to improve overall quality.

*   **ESLint & Prettier:** Set up configuration files in the root of the project to automatically enforce a consistent code style and catch common errors.
*   **Testing:** Introduce basic tests for the new `game-logic.ts` file and the `useGameState` hook to ensure core functionality remains stable during the refactor.
*   **Storybook:** Set up Storybook to develop and showcase the new presentational components in isolation. This will be invaluable for the OpenMoji redesign, as it allows you to perfect the look and feel of each component independently.
