- ✅ Installed core dependencies
- ✅ Set up project structure
- ✅ Created GitHub repository
- ✅ Connected to Vercel for automatic deployments

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Converting the Game - COMPLETED

### What Was Done:
- ✅ Successfully migrated from single-file Claude Artifact to Next.js component
- ✅ Replaced `window.claude.complete` with OpenRouter API calls
- ✅ Maintained all game functionality (mixing, achievements, modes)
- ✅ Implemented responsive design for mobile/desktop

### Key Achievement:
Complete feature parity with original Claude Artifact while adding production architecture.

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Backend API Development - COMPLETED

### What Was Done:
1. **API Routes Implementation** ✅
   - `/api/generate` - OpenRouter integration working perfectly
   - Proper error handling and rate limiting
   - Support for both Science and Creative modes

2. **Environment Variables** ✅
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` configured
   - Secure API key management
   - Vercel environment variables set

### Major Fix Completed:
- ✅ Resolved NextAuth JWT limitations by migrating to Supabase
- ✅ Eliminated all NextAuth dependencies
- ✅ Fixed infinite loop issues causing rate limiting

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Database Integration - COMPLETED

### MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Supabase Integration ✅

#### Database Schema Implemented:
```sql
-- Successfully Deployed Schema
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  is_anonymous BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  subscription_status TEXT DEFAULT 'free',
  subscription_ends_at TIMESTAMP,
  daily_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_count_reset DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE user_elements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  element_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  element_emoji TEXT,
  element_color TEXT,
  game_mode TEXT NOT NULL,
  discovered_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE user_combinations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  element1 TEXT NOT NULL,
  element2 TEXT NOT NULL,
  result TEXT,
  game_mode TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### What's Working ✅:
- **Anonymous user creation** in Supabase
- **Daily counter tracking** from database
- **Supabase Auth integration** with React
- **Clean React architecture** (useMemo, useCallback, proper deps)
- **Performance optimized** (no more infinite loops)

#### Core Issues Resolved with Minor Known Issue ✅:
- **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** - Comprehensive script deployed with enhanced error handling
- **Database Operations** - All critical functions working with graceful fallbacks
- **Anonymous User Access** - Game functions perfectly despite occasional 406 errors during mode switching
- **Known Minor Issue**: 406 errors still appear in console logs but don't impact user experience

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Game State & UX Complete - COMPLETED

### MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS (July 11, 2025):

#### ✅ Complete Game State Persistence System
- **Per-Mode Data Separation**: Science and Creative modes have independent progress
- **Auto-Save with Debouncing**: Game state saved every 2 seconds after changes
- **Cross-Session Restoration**: Progress persists across browser sessions
- **Achievement Preservation**: Proper logic to preserve achievements during resets
- **URL Mode Parameters**: Support for `?mode=science` and `?mode=creative`

#### ✅ Professional Main Menu System
- **Smart Progress Display**: Shows element counts per mode with reset buttons
- **Adaptive Navigation**: "Continue Game" vs "New Game" based on user progress  
- **Mobile Optimization**: Removes emoji prefixes on mobile for space
- **Reset Functionality**: Per-mode reset with confirmation modals
- **Daily Counter Integration**: Shows "Today: 12/50 combinations used"

#### ✅ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Daily Counter Fixed**: Proper incrementation (1→2→3, not stuck at 1)
- **Cross-Mode Contamination Resolved**: Mode switching maintains clean separation
- **Infinite Loop Prevention**: Optimized React hooks prevent loading issues
- **Achievement Duplication Fixed**: "Genesis" achievement no longer unlocks twice

#### ✅ Enhanced User Experience
- **Mobile Layout Optimized**: Back button below title, proper spacing
- **Direct Mode Switching**: No confirmation modals, seamless transitions
- **Modal Improvements**: Click-outside-to-close, cleaner headers
- **Error Handling**: Graceful 406 HTTP error recovery

### Technical Implementation:
- **Database Functions**: `getGameProgress()`, `resetGameState()`, enhanced error handling
- **React Architecture**: Proper `useCallback`/`useMemo` for performance
- **State Management**: Debounced auto-save, mounted flags, clean dependencies
- **Navigation Flow**: Home (`/`) → Game (`/game?mode=X`) with back button

---
